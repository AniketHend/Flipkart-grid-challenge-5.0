## Problem Statement: Personalized Product Recommendations
   The aim is to enhance user experience by implementing a personalized product ranking system.
      Your task is to develop an algorithm or model that can generate accurate and relevant product
      rankings for individual users. The ranking system should consider factors such as user
      preferences, past interactions, product popularity, and user similarity. It should be able to predict
      the most suitable products for a user based on their unique characteristics and preferences.
      You are not provided with a specific dataset for this challenge. Instead, you are expected to
      design and implement a solution that simulates user interactions and generates personalized
      rankings. You can define user profiles, product categories, and interaction patterns within your
      solution.
         To evaluate the effectiveness of your solution, you should define appropriate metrics for
      measuring the accuracy and relevance of the rankings. You should also provide a report
      explaining your approach, describing the algorithms or techniques used, and discussing the
      strengths and limitations of your solution.
     
## Solution
   In this project we are sorting the diffirent products for a perticular user on the basis of cosine similarity

   Cosine Similarity (Collaborative Filtering):
        Cosine similarity is a common approach in collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems. Collaborative filtering relies on analyzing user-item interactions to make personalized recommendations. Cosine similarity measures the similarity between users or items based on their preferences or characteristics. It's well-suited for scenarios where you have user-item interaction data, such as user ratings or purchase histories.
   In collaborative filtering, cosine similarity is used to find users who have similar preferences or items that are similar in terms of the users who like them. This allows the system to make recommendations to a user based on the preferences of similar users, effectively providing personalized recommendations.
